  * [Postico for macOS is really good](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

I recommend using **Homebrew** to install Elixir/Erlang/Node if you are on macOS

If you use Homebrew to install **PostgreSQL**, just be careful you don't `brew upgrade all` or whatever and upgrade it without planning; PSQL version changes (like 19 to 20) sometimes cause compatibility issues with your data/config if not done properly
